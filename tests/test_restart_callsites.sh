# Integration tests for the FOUR call sites the restart-latency change touched in
# files/S99zapret2.new (25.1 s -> 1.73 s on a live aarch64 Keenetic):
#
#   stop_daemon_by_pidfile                        sleep 3  -> z2k_wait_gone
#   run_daemon                                    sleep 1  -> case $DAEMONBASE
#   repair_autocircular_files_after_daemon_start  sleep 1  -> ( sleep 1; ... ) &
#   restart                                       sleep 2  -> usleep 200000
#   start                                         duplicate ensure_autocircular_files removed
#
# Method: the functions under test are lifted verbatim out of the init script
# (which cannot be sourced - it exits unless /opt/zapret2 exists and it sources
# a dozen engine files) and driven in a hermetic sh with counting stubs, mock
# daemons on PATH and temp pid dirs, in the style of test_nfqueue_selfheal.sh.
#
# Every assertion here has been shown to go RED when its hunk is reverted; the
# ones that are invariance guards instead (behaviour the change must NOT alter)
# are marked INVARIANT and were proved by mutating the function they cover.
#
# Point the whole battery at a mutated copy with:
#     Z2K_INIT_UNDER_TEST=/tmp/mutant.sh sh tests/test_restart_callsites.sh
#
# HISTORY - two real defects this battery found in the change, both now fixed and
# both re-verified on the live router:
#
#   * run_daemon watched "${QNUM:-200}" - the STANDARD instance's queue - even for
#     a custom.d daemon told --qnum=65301 (custom.sh allocates 65300-65399), so
#     readiness was decided by an unrelated daemon. Fixed: the queue is derived
#     from the daemon's own argument string.
#   * z2k_wait_queue_bound matched the queue NUMBER only, so an instance whose
#     queue was already bound by another process returned on its first iteration
#     having run no external command. The shell had then not reaped the just-died
#     child, `kill -0` answered for a zombie, and a failed start was reported as
#     "started" with a stale pidfile. Fixed: the match now requires queue AND
#     owner (column 2 = netlink peer portid = the binding pid). Because the wait
#     no longer short-circuits, its usleep runs, the child is reaped and `kill -0`
#     tells the truth - so the old `sleep 1`'s guarantee survives without paying
#     any settle. Re-verified on 192.168.1.1 against the deployed script: a daemon
#     that exits(1) immediately yields "ERROR: Daemon 99 failed to start", rc=1,
#     pidfile removed; a live one yields rc=0.
#
# ROUTER-ONLY (cannot be checked here, no BusyBox/procfs/real usleep locally) -
# all four confirmed on 192.168.1.1 while writing this file:
#   [x] /opt/bin/usleep exists            -> the fractional branch is the live one
#   [x] BusyBox sleep rejects "0.1"       -> the usleep dependency is real
#   [x] /proc/net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue: field 1 is the queue number
#   [x] ash keeps an unreaped child visible to kill -0 (the zombie above)
#   [ ] end-to-end `time S99zapret2 restart` on the live box (covered by
#       test_restart_latency.sh / the 1.73 s measurement, not re-measured here)
#
# POSIX sh.
